A simple syllable counter, plus readability score measure-er.

The package should be reasonably fast and memory efficient, but there is some room for improvement at this time.


## Installation

<!-- You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("sylcount")
``` -->

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
### Pick your preference
devtools::install_github("wrathematics/sylcount", subdir="Rpkg")
ghit::install_github("wrathematics/sylcount", subdir="Rpkg")
remotes::install_github("wrathematics/sylcount", subdir="Rpkg")
```



## Example Usage

Some dumb data:

```r
library(sylcount)
a <- "I am the very model of a modern major general."
b <- "I have information vegetable, animal, and mineral."
```

Readability scores:

```r
readability(a)
#   words nonwords sentences syllables reading.ease grade.level
# 1    10        0         1        16       61.325        7.19
 
# One at a time
readability(c(a, b))
#   words nonwords sentences syllables reading.ease grade.level
# 1    10        0         1        16    61.325000     7.19000
# 2     7        0         1        17    -5.727143    15.79714

# Both at once
readability(paste0(a, b, collapse=" "))
#   words nonwords sentences syllables reading.ease grade.level
# 1    17        0         2        33     33.98397    10.63088
```

Syllable counting:

```r
sylcount(a)
# [[1]]
#       word syllables
# 1        I         1
# 2       am         1
# 3      the         1
# 4     very         2
# 5    model         2
# 6       of         1
# 7        a         1
# 8   modern         2
# 9    major         2
# 10 general         3

sylcount(c(a, b))
## [[1]]
##       word syllables
# 1        I         1
# 2       am         1
# 3      the         1
# 4     very         2
# 5    model         2
# 6       of         1
# 7        a         1
# 8   modern         2
# 9    major         2
# 10 general         3
# 
# [[2]]
#          word syllables
# 1           I         1
# 2        have         1
# 3 information         4
# 4   vegetable         4
# 5      animal         3
# 6         and         1
# 7     mineral         3

sylcount(paste(a, b, collapse=" "))
# [[1]]
#           word syllables
# 1            I         1
# 2           am         1
# 3          the         1
# 4         very         2
# 5        model         2
# 6           of         1
# 7            a         1
# 8       modern         2
# 9        major         2
# 10     general         3
# 11           I         1
# 12        have         1
# 13 information         4
# 14   vegetable         4
# 15      animal         3
# 16         and         1
# 17     mineral         3

## How It Works

The syllable counter first looks up each word in a hash table to see if its syllable count is known.  If not, it uses a vowel counting rule to try to approximate it.  The hash table uses a perfect hash function generated by gperf.  For more information, see `?sylcount`.

For a source for the readability measures, see `?readability`.
